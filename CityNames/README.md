There are 2 .TXT files, one of them is a correct list of cities (they contain all the cities of the country, written correctly) and
 the other one, also a list of cities but with some wrong data (this list suffered user insertions, for this has errors of
 Portuguese, etc). Mount a program that identifies the error in the second list (file) by writing the result of the difference in a
 third .TXT file. In this difference file, I need to identify exactly where the error is and not just display the error.

What should be delivered:
	* Files Fonts (Zipped)
	* Application deploy instructions
	* Program operation mode (how to run).
